# GlaDS 2 WAVI

This repository contains scripts to explore the future coupling between [WAVI.jl](https://github.com/WAVI-ice-sheet-model/WAVI.jl) and GlaDS.

## Repo structure

- [diag_apt_sheet_e_grid_2d.jl](diag_apt_sheet_e_grid_2d.jl) - 2D sheet equation solved using the _Accelerated Pseudo-Transient_ (APT) method on a regular Arakawa E grid with finite-difference discretisation;
- [misc/](misc/) - Simple Newton-Krylov solver for the p-Laplacian equation in 1D.
